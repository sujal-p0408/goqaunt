# GoQuant Trade Simulator Implementation Documentation

## 1. Model Selection and Parameters

### 1.1 Slippage Model
- **Model Type**: Linear regression with market depth consideration
- **Key Parameters**:
  - Order size
  - Market depth at each price level
  - Historical volatility
  - Current spread
- **Implementation**: `OrderBookProcessor.calculate_slippage()`
  - Uses weighted average of price levels based on order book depth
  - Considers market impact at different order sizes
  - Adjusts for current market conditions

### 1.2 Fee Model
- **Model Type**: Tiered fee structure
- **Parameters**:
  - Base fee rate
  - Volume-based discounts
  - Maker/Taker fee differentiation
- **Implementation**: `OrderBookProcessor.calculate_fees()`
  - Supports multiple fee tiers
  - Considers order type (market vs limit)
  - Accounts for volume-based discounts

### 1.3 Market Impact Model
- **Model Type**: Square root model with volatility adjustment
- **Parameters**:
  - Order size
  - Market volatility
  - Average daily volume
  - Current market depth
- **Implementation**: `OrderBookProcessor.calculate_market_impact()`
  - Uses square root model for base impact
  - Adjusts for current volatility
  - Considers market depth for fine-tuning

## 2. Regression Techniques

### 2.1 Price Impact Regression
- **Method**: Linear regression with regularization
- **Features**:
  - Order size
  - Market depth
  - Time of day
  - Volatility
- **Implementation**: `OrderBookProcessor.predict_price_impact()`
  - Uses L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
  - Updates coefficients in real-time
  - Considers market regime changes

### 2.2 Maker/Taker Ratio Prediction
- **Method**: Logistic regression
- **Features**:
  - Historical order flow
  - Market conditions
  - Time-based patterns
- **Implementation**: `OrderBookProcessor.predict_maker_taker_ratio()`
  - Updates predictions based on recent data
  - Considers market microstructure
  - Adapts to changing market conditions

## 3. Market Impact Calculation Methodology

### 3.1 Base Impact Model
```python
def calculate_market_impact(self, order_size, volatility):
    # Square root model for base impact
    base_impact = np.sqrt(order_size / self.avg_daily_volume)
    
    # Volatility adjustment
    vol_adjustment = 1 + (volatility / self.avg_volatility)
    
    # Market depth consideration
    depth_factor = self.calculate_depth_factor()
    
    return base_impact * vol_adjustment * depth_factor
```

### 3.2 Depth Factor Calculation
- Considers order book imbalance
- Accounts for liquidity at different price levels
- Adjusts for market conditions

### 3.3 Volatility Adjustment
- Uses historical volatility data
- Considers current market conditions
- Adjusts impact based on market regime
